This repository contains our work on the Higgs Boson Machine learning challenge, completed as a project for the EPFL machine learning class.

We have put the code into .py files, and demonstrated the code in iPython notebooks.  
Finally we have produced a report to summarise our results.

# Code

implementations.py: contains the required ml methods  
cross_validation.py: code for cross-validating the implementations and calculating their accuracy
run.py: run this code to generate our submission. Remember to set the data paths.

# Notebooks

implementations.ipnb: demonstrating the different ml methods  
project1.ipynb: we explain the pipeline we used to get our results. This includes data exploration, feature processing, and cross validation
